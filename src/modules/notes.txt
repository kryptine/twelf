to do

implement parametrized views
read assignments in structures separately
implement isomorphism check
print out with nicer names

better error message for instantiation/definition clash: no printer available

--------
done

forbid instantiating defined constants
shadowing on toplevel

--------
mail to Carsten

map constants to skolem constants
separate compilation exists
%use in signatures is the same as an include. This also gives qualified names for the constants.
make symbols with fixity parsable separately
