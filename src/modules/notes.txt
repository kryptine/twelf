to do

implement parametrized views
implicit views
read assignments in structures separately
implement isomorphism check
print out with nicer names
alias declarations

scanner:
- resolve MMT URIs in LF file (except for translations) without invoking Twelf
- makes this also resolve comments

jEdit: unicode names by translating to ASCII names for the backend

better error message for instantiation/definition clash: no printer available

--------
done

forbid instantiating defined constants
shadowing on toplevel
implement include in link, only one %include allowed in a link for now
empty %open in include chains name lookups

--------
mail to Carsten

map constants to skolem constants
separate compilation exists
%use in signatures is the same as an include. This also gives qualified names for the constants.
make symbols with fixity parsable separately
