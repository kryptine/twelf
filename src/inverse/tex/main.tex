\begin{abstract} 
This is an experiment at implementing \emph{Canonical LF}.  We intend
to present muliple forms of representation.  We will begin with a
simple name-carrying implementation of Canonical LF.  We will continue
with spine forms and explicit substitutions, and finally add
meta-variables.  Through this process, we hope to experiment with the
various representations to find a good trade-off between efficiency
and elegance.

While we have just described Canonical LF, a language where all
expressions are canonical, it is sometimes useful to relax the canonicity
restriction to take advantage of various implementation 
techniques.  To get a better idea of the efficiency of various
implementations, we present here two different methods of
typechecking, called \emph{eager} and \emph{lazy}, with
two minor variants of each method.
