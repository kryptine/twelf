README file for meta directory
------------------------------

funsyn        implements the functional calculus
funtypecheck  implements a type checker for this calculus
relfun        implements a converter from relational formulation
		of primitive recursive functions as LF signature
		to this functional calculus.


Regression test
---------------

relfun and funtypecheck are regression tested using the
command

	use "TEST/meta.sml";

from the  Twelf-SML top level. 




TODO list for relfun.com

DONE -cs  1) lemmas 
DONE -cs  2) parameter cases
DONE -cs  3) mutual recursion
4) label store




TODO list of meta theorem prover
--------------------------------

Open issues: 
-cs  In recursion, when we look for the subterm of a functional
	assumptions, we apply it to EVars, and continue search.
	Currently we reject any induction hypothesis where any
	of these EVars is open.
     Improvement: univerally abstract over these EVars 
     (see error mesage : 	
	 * Ignored recursive call: Argument not instantiated during unification)


Code Walk (Invariants, Mutual recursion)
DONE -cs Anchor into Twelf

DONE -cs Unify induction hypothesis result/residual lemmas to one construct.
DONE -cs Keep residual lemmas explicit

Make ctxblock adequate for formulas (left to right, instead  right to left)

Parameter Cases
  inductive cases:

    DONE -cs    Pruning in substitution. 
    
    DONE -cs    Add parameter introduction in the case that parameter and functional object
	do not live on the same level
    DONE -cs Add functionality for SOME clauses
    Assumption, all EVars for SOME are replaced by something closed 
	(* not a sensible assumption. Must be generalized *)
