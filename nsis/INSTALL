Instructions to create an installation executable for Windows.

  1. Download and install NSIS. It is available for free, and with sources,
     from:
       http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/

  2. Make sure that the heap images for both twelf-server and twelf-sml
     are inside bin/.heap. If they are not, you can create them by opening
     a command prompt in the Twelf root directory and typing
        sml-cm < twelf-server.sml
        sml-cm < twelf-sml.sml

  3. Right click on the twelf.nsi file and select "Compile NSI".
     This will create an executable file named "twelf-1-3.exe" in the
     Twelf root directory.
