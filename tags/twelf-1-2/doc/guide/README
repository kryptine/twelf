This directory contain the sources for the Twelf User's Guide
written in in Texinfo format in the file

  twelf.texi

The scripts create the indicated version of the manual:

  guide2all  (creates dvi, ps, html, info, BUT NOT pdf)
  guide2dvi  (twelf.dvi, twelf.ps)
  guide2html (twelf_toc.html, twelf_*.html)
  guide2info (twelf.info, visit with C-u C-h twelf.info in Emacs)

  guide2pdf  (twelf.pdf ***Warning: cannot be created under PC/Linux***)

To copy the resulting documentation to the right locations, type

  ./install

To clean this directory to sources only:

  ./clean

This whole directory should probably be rewritten as a Makefile...
