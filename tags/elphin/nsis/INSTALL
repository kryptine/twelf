Instructions to create an installation executable for Windows.

  1. Create the distribution for Unix, unpack it on a Windows machine
     and copy this directory (nsis) into the Twelf root directory.
     The instructions below are meant to be executed from said Windows
     machine.

  2. Edit twelf.nsi to make sure that it reflects the right version number
     and directory structure.

  3. Download and install NSIS, if you haven't done so already. It is
     available for free, and with sources, from:
       http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/

  4. Make sure that the heap images for both twelf-server and twelf-sml
     are inside bin/.heap. If they are not, you can create them by opening
     a command prompt in the Twelf root directory and typing
        sml-cm < twelf-server.sml
        sml-cm < twelf-sml.sml

  5. Right click on the twelf.nsi file and select "Compile NSI".
     This will create an executable file in the Twelf root directory.
