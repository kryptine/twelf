to do

implement parametrized views
implicit views
read assignments in structures separately
implement isomorphism check
print out with nicer names
alias declarations
hiding

scanner:
- resolve MMT URIs in LF file (except for translations) without invoking Twelf
- makes this also resolve comments

better error message for instantiation/definition clash: no printer available

--------
done

added twelf-save-reset-check-file to emacs mode (works together with empty sources.cfg)
forbid instantiating defined constants
shadowing on toplevel
implement include in link, only one %include allowed in a link for now
empty %open in include chains name lookups
signatures may refer to symbols of ancestor signatures (qualified or - if not shadowed - directly)
views are only legal if no ancestor relation between domain and codomain and if all ancestors of domain are ancestors of codomain
%read reads a file; cfg files are deprecated, only elf file needed from now on
OMDoc export prints
 - only modules of main file (if loaded by cfg file, then the first elf file in it)
 - main file name is relative to pwd
 - all references to other modules and files with proper MMT-URIs
 - to do: nested signatures, toplevel signature

--------
mail to Carsten

make symbols with fixity parsable separately
hiding
