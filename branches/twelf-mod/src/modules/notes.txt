Carsten:
make symbols with fixity parsable separately
report lookup errors in recon-term
preserve comments, line/column numbers
install signature names after closing only? then no duplicate names or shadowing?
can readDecl be merged with loadFile, loadString
long ZFC check

to do
make sigRelLookup unique by throwing away every include if a sigRel already exists
remove argument of Included; use extra hash table modIncludes mapping mid to cid list
morphisms should be allowed to include a morphism out of the ancestor, then all signatures are visible (inlcude only possible if ancestor already visible)
anonymous constants
read assignments in structures separately
print out with nicer names
catch exceptions when file not found

filtering
anonymous morphisms
structure variables
parametrized views, functors
patterns
pair types with proof irrelevance
logical relations, morphism equality check, isomorphism check

KM
library infrastructure
- resolve MMT URIs in LF file (except for translations) without invoking Twelf
- make this also resolve comments

ideas
%main in modules to allow reference to one symbol without qualificaion
designated arguments in modules to allow unqualified instantiation
skolem constants

--------
done

unqualified names are looked up in all parents first, first match is used; then in all included signatures, fail if non-unique
links can have multiple includes
implicit links
added twelf-save-reset-check-file to emacs mode (works together with empty sources.cfg)
forbid instantiating defined constants
shadowing on toplevel
implement include in link, only one %include allowed in a link for now
empty %open in include chains name lookups
signatures may refer to symbols of ancestor signatures (qualified or - if not shadowed - directly)
views are only legal if no ancestor relation between domain and codomain and if all ancestors of domain are ancestors of codomain
%read reads a file; cfg files are deprecated, only elf file needed from now on
OMDoc export prints
 - only modules of main file (if loaded by cfg file, then the first elf file in it)
 - main file name is relative to pwd
 - all references to other modules and files with proper MMT-URIs
 - to do: nested signatures, toplevel signature
%struct %implicit and %view %implicit for implicit coercions
