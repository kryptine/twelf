to do

views including themselves lead to infinite loop
implement parametrized views
read assignments in structures separately
implement morphism equality check
implement isomorphism check
print out with nicer names
alias declarations
use environment variable for default search path for files
hiding

scanner:
- resolve MMT URIs in LF file (except for translations) without invoking Twelf
- make this also resolve comments

--------
done

links can have multiple includes
implicit links
added twelf-save-reset-check-file to emacs mode (works together with empty sources.cfg)
forbid instantiating defined constants
shadowing on toplevel
implement include in link, only one %include allowed in a link for now
empty %open in include chains name lookups
signatures may refer to symbols of ancestor signatures (qualified or - if not shadowed - directly)
views are only legal if no ancestor relation between domain and codomain and if all ancestors of domain are ancestors of codomain
%read reads a file; cfg files are deprecated, only elf file needed from now on
OMDoc export prints
 - only modules of main file (if loaded by cfg file, then the first elf file in it)
 - main file name is relative to pwd
 - all references to other modules and files with proper MMT-URIs
 - to do: nested signatures, toplevel signature
%struct %implicit and %view %implicit for implicit coercions

mail to Carsten

make symbols with fixity parsable separately
hiding
