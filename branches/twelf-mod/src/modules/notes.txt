to do
parametrized views and structures
conservative structure declarations: definiens of structure is checked but dropped
  for declared structures this would also check totality
partial views default to identity; _ as module name; then %view %implicit _ : A -> B = {} to check definitional extensions.
make symbols with fixity parsable separately: look for corresponding error message in parse-term.fun; see if it can be done easily
make sigRelLookup unique by throwing away every include if a sigRel already exists?
try to remove argument of Included
read assignments in structures separately
%main c : A. in sig S; s : S used as constant defaults to s.c; same for included signatures
print out with nicer names
are implicit arguments printed?
exception when using non-existing field name of a struct
it should be possible to include morphisms for signatures that are not directly included; defaulting to identity should work even if such an import is already present; use case: import FOL with a single instantiation for the universe

filtering
anonymous morphisms
structure variables
patterns
pair types with proof irrelevance
morphism equality check, isomorphism check

library infrastructure
- resolve MMT URIs in LF file (except for translations) without invoking Twelf
- make this also resolve comments

ideas
designated arguments in modules to allow unqualified instantiation
skolem constants

--------
done

using URIs to identify namespaces and to abstract from file systems
dynamic loading of modules (%read deprecated)
eliminated .. qualifier, lookup now decides dynamically whether a name is a namespace prefix, a module name, or a list of symbol names
all toplevel declarations are pairs of a namespace and a name, prefixes can be declared to access names in other namespaces, namespace defaults to current file, in configurations name lookup searches all namespaces to achieve backwards compatibility
comments via %* *% before a named declaration are preserved with their line/column position
anonymous constants _ : t
logical relations
includes and subsignatures reimplemented, includes can occur anywhere in a signature and include subsignatures
unqualified names are looked up in all parents first, first match is used; then in all included signatures, fail if non-unique
links can have multiple includes
implicit links
added twelf-save-reset-check-file to emacs mode (works together with empty sources.cfg)
forbid instantiating defined constants
shadowing on toplevel
implement include in link, only one %include allowed in a link for now
empty %open in include chains name lookups
signatures may refer to symbols of ancestor signatures (qualified or - if not shadowed - directly)
views are only legal if no ancestor relation between domain and codomain and if all ancestors of domain are ancestors of codomain
%read reads a file; cfg files are deprecated, only elf file needed from now on
OMDoc export prints
 - only modules of main file (if loaded by cfg file, then the first elf file in it)
 - main file name is relative to pwd
 - all references to other modules and files with proper MMT-URIs
 - to do: nested signatures, toplevel signature
%struct %implicit and %view %implicit for implicit coercions
