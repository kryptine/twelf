Regression test suite
Robert J. Simmons, June 2009

The current incarnation of the regression test suite is aimed at being run
with MLton (with a higher cost of compliation, but a drastically reduced
time for running the examples, which seems to make it worth it). The regression
suite is designed to be run on the plparty.org web server, where the results
from a nightly test can be observed at

http://twelf.plparty.org/builds

However, for most public code examples (and an archived and occasionally 
updated version of all Literate Twelf files on the wiki), the regression suite 
can be run locally.

== Method 1: Fully automatic run (linux) ==

twelf$ cd TEST
twelf/TEST$ ./regression.sh

== Method 2: Build regression executable (MLton) == 

twelf$ cd TEST
