Coverage Checker
Author: Frank Pfenning with Carsten Schuermann

Version 1 --- only closed queries and predicates

Coverage checking is LOCAL.  Later we will
use a declaration of the form
 %proves <thm> <fam>.
for more global checking.

Syntax:

%covers mdecl.

where mdecl is a short or full mode declaration.

+ means input coverage
- means output coverage
* means no coverage checking
