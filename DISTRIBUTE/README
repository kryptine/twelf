Twelf Build Process
Author: Robert J. Simmons

There are several scripts that make up the build process; all are intended
to be run from within the DISTRIBUTE directory. The simplest script is the
./build.sh script, which does the following:

 - Exports a fresh copy of twelf from Subversion
 - Removes non-distribution files
 - Creates the twelf-src.tar.gz source tarball
 - Compiles twelf-server with mlton
 - Removes source files
 - Creates the twelf-compiled.tar.gz binary tarball

The ./build.sh script can be used from any computer with mlton installed.

The scripts controller-linux.sh and controller-osx.sh, which SHOULD ONLY BE
RUN FROM THE RESPECTIVE OPERATING SYSTEMS, are intended only to be run in 
environments where there is a password-free connection to the Twelf webspace,
specified in the $REMOTE_DIR variable. The osx version of the controller uses 
the files in osx to create a pretty disk image for Twelf.
